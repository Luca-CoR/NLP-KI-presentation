# NLP-KI-presentation
A repository for all the preparation for my presentation on a paper called "Large Language Models Understand and Can Be Enhanced by Emotional Stimuli" <br/>

The paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11760v7 <br/>

This was done as part of a Seminary class at Leipzig University. Have fun looking through here. <br/>

There will be additional papers and resources in the material folder, as well as work in progress (notes on my presentation, etc) in the notes folder
